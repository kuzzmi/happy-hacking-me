1. This repository is my diary of a journey in the world of a keybord-building and some source code for keyboard firmware I'll be using for a custom keyboard with custom layout.

### Goals:

1. Make a custom keyboard that:
    * is split
    * is mechanical
    * has Shift next to thumbs
    * is reprogrammable
    * has layers
2. Learn how to do electronics stuff
3. Learn where and how to order parts

If you take a look at your space bar you'll find that the most used parts of it are the sides and the middle is usually clean and untouched. I find myself often press Shift key so I thought about making a keyboard that has a Shift key in the middle of the space bar.

My hands are often positioned with an angle between them and a keyboard. Like this: `[ / \ ]`. And because of that it's kind of difficult for my pinkies to reach appropriate keys when needed. That thought brought me to the question about split or rotated keyboard.
